# JPEG-Compression

This program implements the JPEG compression algorithm in MATLAB. It also caclulates the pixel-wise and Peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR) for each of the images. The 'main' method of the program is the compressImages.m file. Run this file in matlab to process the 3 images in the directory, named image1.jpg, image2.jpg, and image3.jpg.

This program was written by TJ Couch, Austin Vickers, and Matthew Robertson
